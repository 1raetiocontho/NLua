# Interpex IX1D V3.53 15: A Powerful Software for Geophysical Data Processing and Inversion
 
Interpex IX1D V3.53 15 is a software program that allows users to process, invert and display geophysical data from various methods, such as direct current (DC) resistivity, induced polarization (IP), magnetotelluric (MT) and electromagnetic (EM) sounding. It supports most DC resistivity arrays, including Wenner, Schlumberger, dipole-dipole, pole-dipole and pole-pole arrays. It also supports resistivity only or resistivity with IP measurements in terms of PFE, chargeability in msec or phase in mrad. For MT sounding inversion, it supports apparent resistivity and impedance phase. For frequency-domain EM sounding inversion, it supports horizontal coplanar, vertical coplanar and vertical coaxial configurations with in-phase and quadrature measurements in percent or ppm of the primary field. For EM conductivity measurements, it supports apparent conductivity in milliSiemens/m. For transient EM (TEM) measurements, it supports central loop, fixed loop or coincident loop configurations (additional license fee required).

Interpex IX1D V3.53 15 has many features that make it easy and convenient to use. Users can create data by spreadsheet entry or copy/paste from another spreadsheet. They can also import data or models from flat ASCII files. Models can be entered as either depth models or layer thickness models. Layer boundary elevations are shown and calculated relative to surface elevations. The model entry dialog box allows for dynamic column and row manipulations to make model entry more convenient. Users can also fix parameters for the inversion calculations by using fix flags. Either the layer thickness (or depth) and/or the resistivity can be fixed in the inversion process.
 
Interpex IX1D V3.53 15 also has a feature that allows users to read in a resistivity well log from a flat ASCII file and interactively reduce the log to several discreet layers by fitting straight line segments to the cumulative conductance in the log. The resulting model can be copied to the model in the current data set for further modeling.
 
Interpex IX1D V3.53 15 has a graphical user interface that displays the data and model in various ways. Users can view the data as apparent resistivity or impedance versus frequency, coil spacing or instrument height; as apparent conductivity versus frequency; as TEM decay curves; or as MT apparent resistivity and phase versus period. Users can also view the model as a layered earth with resistivity values; as a cumulative conductance plot; or as an elevation section with color fill. Users can zoom in or out on any graph; change the scales, labels and colors; add annotations; print or save the graphs; or copy them to the clipboard.
 
Interpex IX1D V3.53 15 is a powerful software that can handle various types of geophysical data and provide accurate and reliable inversion results. It is suitable for geologists, geophysicists, engineers and researchers who are interested in exploring the subsurface structure and properties of the earth using electrical methods.
